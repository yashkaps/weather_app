# Weather App
Used Python's Tkinter library to create a GUI to display weather information obtained from OpenWeatherMap.org using GET requests (Python's Requests library) to query the API

## How to use
The entry field takes in one of 2 formats:
(i) A city name and (optional) country code, or
(ii) A zipcode and (optional) country code

## Output
The output box displays the name and country of the location, along with a text description of weather conditions, and the actual temperature (in degree Fahrenheit)

## Files
- WeatherApp.py: the actual code, without my API key. A personal key can be generated by making a free account at OpenWeatherMap.org (I am not sponsored in any way)
- img.png: the image used as the background 
- sun_icon.ico: the icon of the executable created using PyInstaller 
- WeatherApp.exe: the executable file created using PyInstaller. Can run on any Windows computer, and does *not* require Python to be installed on the machine.
